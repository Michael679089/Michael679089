# Problem 
- With the Philippines becoming a popular tourist destination for Westerners, venturing into hotels offers a promising business opportunity.

I wasn’t able to get any data from Kaggle about Philippine Hotel Prices in Philippines so what I got was from Various room prices from Europe instead.
